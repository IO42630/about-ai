# A Neuro

* KISS Neural Network
* 1 Input Node with value 1
* 2 Hidden Nodes (with RelU)
  * Inputs: Weight = 1, Bias = 2
* 1 Output Node (with RelU)
  * Inputs: Weight = 2, Bias = 3


## Steps

* Step 1
  * 1
* Step 2
  * (1 * 1 + 2) -> relu -> 3
  * (1 * 1 + 2) -> relu -> 3
* Step 3
  * (3 * 2 + 3) -> relu -> 9
  * (3 * 2 + 3) -> relu -> 9
* Step 4
  * 18
